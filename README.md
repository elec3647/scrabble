# Scrabble Solver
---------------
My scrabble program for finding words in the popular Words with Friends game.

## Getting Started

* Clone this repository locally.
* Ensure that you have Python installed.

### Prerequisites

Please see the requirements.txt file. Currently my program will only search for words based on patterns, but I'm working on processing screenshots of WwF which would require some image processing libraries.

### Installing

No installation is currently required. Just clone the repo.

```
git clone {repository URL}
```
